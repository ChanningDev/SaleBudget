<h2>SalesBudget Application</h2>


<h3>Code-first approach</h3>
<p>Unlike the BudgetStatus app-prototype, in the new SalesBudget app I have adopted a different approach, namely a
code-first approach. This means that he started from the code, and then from the models, to automatically generate 
the tables in the database.</p>

<h3>Repository Pattern</h3>
<p>Another peculiarity of the development of this application, as regards the backend architecture, is the adoption 
of the Repository Pattern. In particular, the Repository Pattern is an architecture that adds a further level of 
abstraction to the backend logic, using a Data Access Layer. The detail will be explained later in the manual.</p> 

<h3>JavaScript</h3> 
<p>In addition to Microsoft technologies, I had to use and add JavaScript code in the front-end logic of the application,
in order to satisfy particular requirements that would have otherwise been too laborious to create with C# code, and other 
times not possible.</p>
