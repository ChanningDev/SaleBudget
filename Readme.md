<h2>App SalesBudget</h2>
</br>
</br>
<h3>Code-first approach</h3></br>
Unlike the BudgetStatus app-prototype, in the new SalesBudget app I took a different approach, namely a code-first approach. 
This means that I started from the code, and thus from the templates, to automatically generate the tables in the database.
</br>
<h3>Repository Pattern</h3>h3></br>
Another special feature of the development of this application, as far as the backend architecture is concerned, is the adoption 
of the Repository Pattern. In particular, the Repository Pattern is an architecture that adds a further level of abstraction to the 
backend logic, using a Data Access Layer. The detail will be explained later in the manual. 
</br>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>h3></br>
In addition to Microsoft technologies, I had to use and add JavaScript code in the front-end logic of the application, in order to 
fulfil particular requirements that would otherwise have been too laborious to create with C# code, and at other times not possible.
